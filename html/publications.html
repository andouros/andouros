      <h3>Real-world effects of direct oral anticoagulants</h3>
      <p>
        Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are blood thinners that are used to prevent and treat thrombotic disease. 
	The most common indications include non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE). 
	In the past years, I studied the utilization of DOACs in various populations including patients with NVAF
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28984052" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and patients with NVAF and underlying liver disease
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34409636/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. I also addressed important safety concerns related to the use of DOACs. 
	For example, I assessed their risk of liver injury
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29519351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (see also Graphical Abstract), 
	 thereby showing that DOACs do not increase the risk of this potentially fatal adverse effect when compared to the therapeutic alternative vitamin K antagonists. These findings provided reassurance regarding the hepatic safety of DOACs. 
	I also studied their risk of esophageal disorders
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32377758/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and their risk of major bleeding when used together with antiplatelet agents in patients with NVAF
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30691551/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and in patients with venous thromboembolism
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35036824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
        Moreover, I assessed the effectiveness and safety of DOACs in high-risk populations such as octogenarians with VTE
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36150513/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and patients with cancer related thrombosis
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33836492/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

      <h3>Safety of sulfonylureas</h3>
      <p>
        Sulfonylureas are oral antidiabetic drugs commonly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. 
	They are efficacious in controlling blood glucose levels; however, there are concerns regarding their cardiovascular and hypoglycemic safety. 
	Given the use  of sulfonylureas at different stages of  type 2 diabetes, I studied their safety both as first-line treatments
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28864502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and second-line treatments
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30021781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
        I also specifically studied the safety of glimepiride, a sulfonylurea often used as active comparator in randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of newer antidiabetic drugs
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31596043/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
        Recently, several studies funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and led by my trainee Jenny Dimakos focused on the risk of severe hypoglycemia due to concomitant use of 
	sulfonylureas and warfarin
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35984011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, beta-blockers
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36525638" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (see also Graphical Abstract) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37326010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
	Overall, this work has advanced our understanding regarding the overall safety of profile of these commonly used antidiabetic drugs.

      <h3>Safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors</h3>
      <p>
        Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a newer class of oral antidiabetic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic conditions. 
	In 2020, I was selected to lead an international, multicenter study on their safety. The study was conducted by the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES), one of the largest pharmacoepidemiologic networks in the world. The aim was to assess the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitors, 
	which was an important safety concern according to several regulatory agencies. We observed an almost 3-fold increased risk of this potentially fatal adverse effect with SGLT2 inhibitors
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32716707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (see also Graphical Abstract). 
	Outside of CNODES, I have also studied their risk of venous thromboembolism
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33316246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and the safety of their interaction with statins
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36912450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
